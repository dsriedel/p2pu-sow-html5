	<h2>We would like to hear from you !</h2>
	<p>We are excited with the changes brought about with the newest version of HTML. We are looking forward to the new semantic tags that allow for improved accesibilty, we are pleased with other new features such as easier audio and video inclusion and the new input types for forms. However, we would also like to hear your take on this and what you expect from HTML5? What changes do you think it will bring?</p><br>
	<p>In addition we would like to know a little bit about you. What is your experience with the web? Are you a programmer or designer? What is your experience with HTML5? Have you started including it in your websites?</p><br>
